### üë®‚Äçüíª About me

My name is Roman Zandler, software developer based in Haifa, Israel. I strive to apply my knowledge in practice and make a positive impact on the world.‚ú®

In my pinned repositories, you can find projects that I have either created or contributed to. The majority of them are Java REST services built with Spring Boot or Spring Framework. ‚òï

In my free time, I enjoy solving problems on codewars.com and exploring new libraries (Chronicle, Disruptor, Sphinx 4, FastAPI) and technologies (Reactive Programming, LLM, Java Concurrency, Flutter). You can learn more about me and the projects I'm involved in on my personal site: https://rmnzndlr.web.app üìü
