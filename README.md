My name is Roman Zandler, Java-developer.

I am amazed by the ability to create entire worlds within a program using a limited set of commands, particularly in languages built on the OOP paradigm, such as Java. I strive to apply my knowledge in practice and make a positive impact on the world.âœ¨

In my pinned repositories, you can find projects that I have either created or contributed to. The majority of them are Java REST services built with Spring Boot or Spring Framework.

In my free time, I enjoy solving problems on codewars.com and exploring new libraries (Chronicle, Disruptor, Sphinx 4) and technologies (IoT, AI, Java Concurrency).
