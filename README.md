Hi there! 🔭

I am amazed by the ability to create entire worlds within a program using a limited set of commands, particularly in languages built on the OOP paradigm, such as Java. I strive to apply my knowledge in practice and make a positive impact on the world.✨

In my pinned repositories, you can find projects that I have either created or contributed to. The majority of them are Java REST services built with Spring Boot or Spring Framework.
